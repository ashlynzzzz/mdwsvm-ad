    '''
    This function aims to do hybrid version of MDWSVM and 1-class SVM for comparison

    Input: 
        X_train:    traing data matrix of interest (d by n) where n is the number of training samples and d is the number of features
        y_train:    training labels
        X_test:     test data matrix (d by m)

        for one_class_svm:
        v:      hyperparameter within (0,1)
        K:      kernel, the default is a radius-based Gaussian kernel

        for mdwsvm:
        W:      vertices matrix for all classes: (K-1) by K
        C:      constraint hyperparameter on B which is the coefficient in f
        alp:    weighting parameter, the default value of 0.5
        
    Output: 
        y_train:    labels for training data
        y_test:     labels for test data
