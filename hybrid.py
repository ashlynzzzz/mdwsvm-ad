    This function aims to do hybrid version of MDWSVM and 1-class SVM for comparison

    Input: 
        X:      Data Matrix of interest (p by n) where n is the number of training samples and p is the number of features
        for one_class_svm:
        v:      hyperparameter within (0,1)
        K:      kernel, the default is a radius-based Gaussian kernel
        for mdwsvm:
        W:      vertices matrix for all classes
        C:      constraint hyperparameter on B which is the coefficient in f
        alp:    weighting parameter, the default value of 0.5
        
    Output: 
        y_train:    labels for training data
        y_test:     labels for test data
